three thoughts to graph clusters:
  1)  plot centroids around some shape (circle?) using relative distance from each other.
      plot other points using absolute distance from all centroids and color by cluster
  2)  simple network.  connect points to their centroids with solid lines, dotted lines to next two proximate.
      use physics/spring to lay network out.
  3)  after clustering, user chooses which two variables are most important, just graph those.
